\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
The rise of Machine Learning (ML), and especially Neural Networks (NN), has created so far unheard-of capabilities for predictive analysis in the context of individual traffic in the modern transportation landscape. As digitalization emerged rapidly over the past years the possibilities for data-driven decision making further evolved as well. In general data-driven decision making is a process which involves collecting data to measure goals or Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Furthermore data gathered through business processes can also be consulted in order to support business owners during their decision making process.

Predictive analysis involves statistical techniques and ML algorithms to analyse current as well as historical information in order to predict future events. The applications of predictive analysis span various sectors and industries. In finance it can be utilized to predict stock market trends \cite{stock_market}. When looking at healthcare it can assist in predicting diseases and to support doctors in their diagnosis \cite{health_care}. In retail it can help to understand customer behaviours \cite{retail}. How well certain algorithms can perform is influenced by the quality of available data \cite{data_qual}. In recent years ML techniques especially NN demonstrated promising results when it comes to time series forecasting. Certain NN models have the ability to detect non-linear relationship within a given dataset. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are commonly used approaches in this area as they have the ability to capture long term dependencies \cite{intro_ml_1}.

One key for every business is to stay ahead of their competitors by continuously improving the offered service. 
In context of individual transportation services data gathered from a digital booking platform can reveal valuable information like customer preferences, preferred travel times, common departure and destination places as well as seasonal booking patterns.
