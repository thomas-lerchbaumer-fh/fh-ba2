\chapter{Implementation of Averages and Grouping}
\label{chap:analytical_dashboard}
This section focuses on the implementation of various groupings as well as their visualization. As the analytical dashboard is web based a short overview about its technical setup is given in section \ref{sec:tech_set}.

\section{Technical Setup}
\label{sec:tech_set}
As those implementations will contribute to an analytical dashboard the visualization of the prepared data are implemented using React. For each grouping a separate React component is created. Communication between the front- and backend is accomplished using a Rest interface. 

\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|React|\footnote{https://react.dev/} - used to Visualize
\item \verb|Python|\footnote{https://www.python.org/} - used to implement the grouping logic
\item \verb|fastapi|\footnote{https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/} - Rest interface (Connection between Backend and Frontend) 
\item \verb|geopy|\footnote{https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/} - Used for calculations on latitude and longitude 
\end{itemize}
