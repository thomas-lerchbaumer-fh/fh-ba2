\chapter{Prediction Model}
\label{chap:prediction_model}
General Infos and solutions. Explain what the model should do.

\section{Technical Setup}
What technologies are used etc. 

\section{The Model}
how the model is created, which attributes are used etc. 

\section{Supervised Learning - Training Data}
Explain supervised learning approach for the model

\section{Unsupervised Learning}
explain unsupervised learning apporach for the model

\section{Comparison - Supervised, Unsupervised}

\section{Model accuracy}
Having a look at the model performance accuracy (comparing predictions of the model with already available data) , explain potential twerks that have been applied to the model itself to achieve a higher level of accuracy.
