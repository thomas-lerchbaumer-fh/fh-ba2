\chapter{Predicting Future Bookings}
\label{chap:predict}
The knowledge of potential future bookings provide useful insights when it comes to yield management. Yield management in general describes controlling price and capacity control in a simultaneous ways \cite{yield_m}. Therefore those predictions can be used to support bus operators in their pricing strategy.  This chapter focuses on creating two prediction models utilizing different techniques based on the data that is available. 
Both models are implemented using python and the following libraries. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  \verb|matplotlib|\footnote{https://matplotlib.org/} - used for plotting
\item \verb|pandas|\footnote{https://pandas.pydata.org/} - used for data manipulation 
\item \verb|tesnorflow|\footnote{https://www.tensorflow.org/} - provides ML models
\item \verb|keras|\footnote{https://keras.io/} - Neural Network library
\end{itemize}

As there are various models available a literature review was conducted to figure out which models fit the purpose of time series forecasting. It turns out that the most promising NN that can be utilized for time series prediction are either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\cite{nn_1}\cite{nn_2}\cite{lstm_1}\cite{lstm_2}.

\section{Backpropagation}

As both of the models LSTM and CNN use back propagation (BP) for its training the basic concepts of the algorithm are explained in this section. To understand the logic of backpropagation a few terms need a detailed explanation: 
\subsubsection{Gradient}
The gardient also called gradient descent is an algorithm that is used to optimize the loss function within backpropagation. That means that the gradient descent indicates by how much the weights and biases need to be adjusted in order to reduce the actual error value which is the result of the applied loss function. \cite{bp_basic}
\subsubsection{Bias}
The bias is an additional parameter used in each neuron of a NN. It is used to directly influence the activation function to offset the results either to the negative or positive direction. When looking at the sigmoid function without any bias in place where \verb|x| correlates to the input value and \verb|w| indicates the used weight: 
\begin{equation}
 \sigma(x) = \frac{1} {1 + e^{-{(w*x)}}}
\label{eq:eq_4}
\end{equation}
When looking at figure \ref{fig:sig_wo_bias} the weights only influence the steepness of the function but won't shift it along the x axes.
\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/sigmoid_w_weights}
	\caption{Sigmoid function with different weights and no bias - [source:\cite{lstm_module}]}
	\label{fig:sig_wo_bias}
\end{figure}
 To shift the function along the x axes the sigmoid function is adapted with the bias \verb|b| value: 
\begin{equation}
 \sigma(x) = \frac{1} {1 + e^{-{(w*x+b)}}}
\label{eq:eq_4}
\end{equation}
By adding the bias value as constant to the sigmoid function can be shifted along the x axes as shown in \ref{fig:sig_w_bias}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/bias}
	\caption{Sigmoid function with same weights but different bias - [source:author]}
	\label{fig:sig_w_bias}
\end{figure}
The bias therefore is utilized to directly influence the result of the activation function and whether or not a certain neuron is activated or not. 
\subsubsection{Activation Function}
Activation functions introduce non-linearity characteristics to NN. This function is applied to the output of a neuron and decides weather or not a neuron is activated or not.\cite{activation}. In combination with the descent gradient this function enables the NN to learn complex patterns within a training set. Orignially the sigmoid function \cite{bp_basic} was used as activation function for NN but as of today multiple other functions like softmax, Tanh, ReLu emerged \cite{activation}.

\subsubsection{Phases} 
 Backpropagation follows an iterative process. At the beginning there is the feed forward pass. During this phase the input data is passed through all layers. Each hidden layer applies a linear function to create certain weights those outputs then are fed to the activation function. Depending on how many hidden layers are used within the NN the output of the activation function is used as input for the next neuron. At the end the predicted outputs by the model are compared with the actual outputs of the training data. This comparison is evaluated through a loss function. At this step the actual learning process of the model starts by calculating the gradient of the loss function considering the output of the NN. After that the back pass is initiated. Along this phase the gradients of each previous layers are multiplied with a local gradient it's weights which results in a gradient in respect to the layer's inputs. After receiving all gradients  based on the network's input data, all weights and biases are updated and optimized to reduce the result of the loss function. The steps forward pass, loss calculation, back pass, and the updates of weight and biases are repeated to improve the network in an iterative way. \cite{bp_basic} Figure \ref{fig:bp} demonstrates the logic of the backpropagation algorithm. Whereas \verb|wu| represents the updated weights after each iteration.

\section{The Models}
Both models CNN and RNN/LSTM can be used for time series forecasting. To create accurate prediction models a basic knowledge about models functionality is required. Therefore this section explains the components of each NN as well as the approaches those models follow. 

\subsection{LSTM}
LSTM is an RNN and was invented by \cite{lstm_inventor} in 1997. Until today this NN is widley used for time series forecasting and provides reliable results for short as well as long term predictions \cite{rnn_moharm}. LSTM have so called memory cells which are responsible to store the state of data. Whenever information arrives at a memory cell its outcome is defined by refreshing the cell state with the newly arrived information. LSTM utilizes gates to control a cells state by either including or excluding information \cite{lstm_stock}. The gates are called: 
\begin{itemize}
\item input gate - data selection and storage for upcoming state
\item forget gate - data selection and storage which will not be used for the upcoming state
\item output gate - sets information within the state that is send to the output
\end{itemize}
Those gates are created by combining sigmoid functions. The results of this gates are values ranging from zero to one. A result of zero indicates the cell to not pass any infomration whereas values close to one indicates the cell to pass all information. 
The LSTM Module or Repeating module consists of four NN layers which interact together as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lstm_rep_model}:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{images/lstm_module}
	\caption{Repeating LSTM Module - [source:\cite{lstm_module}]}
	\label{fig:lstm_rep_model}
\end{figure}
In total the repeating model has 3 gate activation functions which are named $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$,  $\sigma_3$ and shown in figure \ref{fig:lstm_rep_model}. Furthermore $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ act as output activation functions too. The cell state is illustrated using a blue line which starts at St-1 which indicates the previous memory block to St representing the current memory block. The amount of information that is passed is regulated by layer  $\sigma_1$ using the following function:
\begin{equation}
cf_t = \sigma_1 (W_cf * [O_t-1, x_t] + b_cf)
\cite{lstm_module}
\label{eq:eq_1}
\end{equation}
Furthermore two network layers are used to store new information to the cell state. Therefore sigmoid layer $\sigma_2$ chooses the values which are updated by utilizing the following formula:
\begin{equation}
l_t = \sigma_2(W_1 *[O_t-1, x_t]+ b_l)
\cite{lstm_module}
\label{eq:eq_2}
\end{equation}
Layer $\phi_1$ or \verb|tanh| is created by using new candidate values. This layer outputs a  vector by utilzing the following formular: 
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{S}_t = tanh(W_s * [O_t-1, X_t] + b_s)
\cite{lstm_module}
\label{eq:eq_3}
\end{equation}
The last step includes combination of both states \ref{eq:eq_2} and \ref{eq:eq_3} which is added to the state. Also the state is reconditioned by applying: \cite{lstm_module}
\begin{equation}
S_t = cf_t * S_t1 + I_t * \widetilde{S}_t-1
\cite{lstm_module}
\label{eq:eq_4}
\end{equation}

The reason why a LSTM model is used for this purpose is that a standalone RNN is challenging to train due its characteristics. As Back propagation is used for RNN's problems like vanishing-gradient occur. The gradient in general can be understand as a computed value through all time setps which in the end used to update parameters of the RNN. The vanasihing-gratdient over time results in information decay. By implementing an LSTM module this problem can be solved. \cite{lstm_overcome_rnn_problem}

\subsection{CNN}
CNN's follow the concept of NN consisting of multiple layers. The scope of application for this kind of network reaches from computer vision problems to time-series forecast modelling. Whereas data provided for image classification is structured in multi dimensional arrays (matrices), data used for time-series forecasting is provided via one dimensional arrays.\cite{cnn_intro} A CNN provides different types of layers . Those layer types are called pooling layer (PL), fully connected (FC), Convolution layer (CL) and flatten layer (FL). The connection of those layers are demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:cnn_struct}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/1d_cnn_model}
	\caption{One Dimensional CNN Structure - [source:\cite{cnn_vechicle}]}
	\label{fig:cnn_struct}
\end{figure}

CNN is based on convolution which is a linear operation that multiplies input data with convolution filters. Those filters which are also called kernels correlate to a set of weights \cite{cnn_vechicle}. The kernel values are created during the learning process and are optimized from the NN utilizing back propagation. Furthermore this layer is utilized to detect features within the given one dimensional array. Those features are stored within a feature map and are calculated by applying convolutions on the input data. One crucial parameter to detect proper features is the size of the kernel. The kernel size can be understand as a number of weights that are multiplied with the input data. After each multiplication the sequence is shifted along the input data. Each shift during this process produces one output which is stored in the feature map. The following example demonstrates how this process is done.\cite{1d_cnn}
\begin{lstlisting}
Input Data: [4,7,10,43,20,10] e.g. number of bookings per day. 
Kernel: [0.5,0.25,0.2] Kernel size = 3
1st Multiplication: 4*0.5 + 7*0.25 + 10*0.2 = 5.75
2nd Multiplication: 7*0.5 + 10*0.25 + 43*0.2 = 14.6
...
Output sequence [5.75, 14.6, ...]
\end{lstlisting}
The second operation that is used within the CNN is called activation function. This non-linear function is utilized to detect complex relationships between variables and are applied onto the feature map. As of today multiple functions like ReLU, Sigmoid and softmax can be used as activation functions \cite{cnn_basic3}.

The pooling layer as shown in figure \ref{fig:cnn_struct} is deployed within a NN to diminish the size of feature maps. To reduce the size pooling operations like average pooling, max pooling or sum pooling can be applied. Applying one of those operations results in less computational efford.\cite{cnn_basic}

The activation function is used within the fully connected layer. This layer applies the activation function onto the feature map and enables the model in combination with backpropagation to learn complex connections between features.\cite{1d_cnn}

The flatten layer transforms two dimensional input data into one dimensional input vectors. It's output is used to provide outputs to the fully connected layer. Over-fitting can be caused whenever all features are used in the flatten layer therefore a dropout layer can be set in place. This layer cancels out neurons during the training process of a NN which reduces the model's size. 

\section{Overfitting and Underfitting}
One problem that can occur when utilizing NN for predictions is over-fitting or under-fitting of the training data. Both scenarios result in a poor performance of the trained model.
\subsection{Overfitting}

Overfitting describes the phenomenon that the model is not able to improve its problem solving capabilities after a certain period of training. There are multiple reasons for the occurrence of overfitting. One reason for example is a inaccurate or unbalanced training set. This leads to the fact that the NN produces wrong connections during its training.  Whereas the results for the training set are accurate the problems  occur during the validation phase because the model learned wrong characteristics. \cite{fitting} 
\subsection{Underfitting}
On the other hand underfitting arises when the model is not capable of identifying the traits of the training set and therefore struggles to achieve matching its target values. This results in a high loss values. Reasons for underfitting are caused by a lack of trainable parameters as well as a NN model with a simple architecture in terms of hidden layers.
\\\newline In section \ref{sec:data_cleansing} and \ref{sec:data_aug} actions were taken to avoid both overfitting and underfitting.
