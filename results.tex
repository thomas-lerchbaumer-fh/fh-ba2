\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
The conducted analysis on search requests revealed several valuable insights ranging from averages used in a timely context to seasonal bookings patterns. Whereas averages can be conducted by bus operators for their future planing and decision making. By looking at averages and their development over time bus operators can use attributes like pax and travelled distance in meters for their future fleet planning and bus requirements. Furthermore the hourly grouping of search requests revealed peak hours. This information further can be used to optimize the scheduling of advertising campaigns. Bookings grouped by their date highlighted seasonal trends. As this seasonal trend is repeating throughout the years the knowledge can be used to optimize the pricing strategy. Moreover groupings of departure and destination regions revealed certain areas with high utilization. This fact can also be used to influence an operators pricing strategy as well as an operators decision to increase his initial range to start a journey. Also departure areas with low coverages in terms of bus offers are revealed by changing the initial request to the databases. All the information above can either be used to maximize an operators profit and also to support during data driven decision making. Furthermore the visualization of the metrics mentioned above support operators as well as the team from busfinder to derive certain trends and subsequently use the gathered insights during their decision making process.

To avoid the occurrence of overfitting the lack of data during the pandemic was compensated utilizing data augmentation. Furthermore the analysis on the available data highlighted seasonal trends which were further utilized during the process of feature engineering. 
The experiment carried out during chapter \ref{chap:predict} demonstrated that the available data suffices to create a prediction model capable of predicting the future capacity required of buses. The most accurate results were achieved by utilizing a LSTM model. Whereas the prediction are not 100\% accurate the model is capable of predicting peaks that occurred within the test set. Using the predicted values improves the current YM in place because future bookings can be assessed and therefore the pricing for high utilization days can be adapted. As faulty predictions could lead to negative effects within a production environment security mechanisms need to be integrated. Furthermore continues training and model enhancements are required to ensure the models performance.
