\chapter{Future work}
\label{chap:future_work}
To further enhance the prediction model information from the whole production database of busfinder could be analysed. This might reveal additional features which might improve the model's performance. Additionally the available structure and model could be utilized to predict the date where bookings are actually made. This information could further be used to optimize marketing campaigns. As the scope of this thesis was narrowed down to two tables from the database analysis of the whole production database could be conducted in order to extract more insights that help to improve the offered service as well as support operators and busfinder whenever data driven decision approaches are used.
